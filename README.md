1) Datasets-Test folder contains all the 4 test datasets we used in our research. 
2) Datasets-Train would have contained 5 training DS. But 3 of them are too large (larger than 25mb) so could not be uploaded here. They are uploaded as binary resources(published). The folder contains 2 training DS which are within the 25mb limit. 
3) Model training folder contains all the code for training models. for details, please read our paper. 
4) Tools folder contains code for augmentation and summarization. It also contains code for alternate line truncation which may be useful for some people.
