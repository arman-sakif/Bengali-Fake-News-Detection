# Tackling Fake News in Bengali: Unraveling the Impact of Summarization vs. Augmentation on Pre-trained Language Models
A research work on Bengali Fake news detection through summarization and augmentation using pre trained BERT models. This repository contains all the codes we used in our research

1) Datasets-Test folder contains all the 3 test datasets we used in our research. 
2) Datasets-Train would have contained 4 files for two training DS(without and with summarization). But 2 of them are too large (larger than 25mb) so could not be uploaded here. They are uploaded as binary resources(published). The folder contains 2 training DS which are within the 25mb limit. 
3) Model training folder contains all the code for training models. for details, please read our paper. 
4) Tools folder contains code for augmentation and summarization.

Each folder contains their own readme texts. Please read them.
